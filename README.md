Chatbots, powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), have revolutionized the way we interact with technology. 
NLP enables chatbots to understand and respond to human language in a remarkably human-like manner, making them invaluable tools in various industries. 
These intelligent programs can engage in conversations, answer queries, and even provide personalized recommendations, enhancing customer service, streamlining information retrieval, 
and fostering more natural and efficient human-computer interactions. As NLP technology continues to advance, chatbots are poised to become increasingly indispensable in our daily lives,
simplifying complex tasks and expanding their presence across diverse domains, from customer support to healthcare and beyond.

Here is a simple implementation of a chatbot using Pytorch and deployed using Render.
